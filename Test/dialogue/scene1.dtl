"Lam Anh" (half_open_sollem): I’m home. Sorry for the wait, Thanh Mai.
"Anh Long" (open_eye_sad): Lam Anh. You’re back.
"Lam Anh" (open_eye_neutral): Hey, Anh Long
"Anh Long": Are you packing up Thanh Mai’s belongings? I can help if you want.
"Lam Anh": Thanks, Long. I’d rather keep things the way they are. Every item here holds the memory of Thanh Mai.
"Lam Anh": …I can’t bear to put them away.
"Anh Long":  I…see.  
"Lam Anh": Maybe this sounds foolish…, but I'm giving the bakery another go.
"Anh Long" (open_eye_sad): This soon? Are you sure?
"Lam Anh" (half_open_sollem): It took her years of hard work to bring this bakery to life. Just for it to crash down in a blink. I can’t let that happen.
